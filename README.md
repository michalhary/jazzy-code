Jazzy recruitment task
======================


___________

## Overview

Your todays task will be to code a simple API with 4 endpoints.

We prefer Symfony2/3 or Node.js, but any other framework is good.

## Detailed description

API should:


* Provide means to manage entities of "Gnomes":
  * Create new Gnome,
  * Read Gnome,
  * Update Gnome,
  * Delete Gnome

  Gnome object has such properties:
  * Name - any string
  * Strength - int(0-100)
  * Age - int(0-100)
  * Avatar - png file (any size and resolution).

## Requirements/Suggestions

* Project should be done on git, with proper commits history (one commit is not a history)
* Project should be pushed to public git repository
* Final implementation should be on master branch
* You should use some framework
* Provide readme file!
* Autp-generated swagger docs (or other) is a big plus.

## What will be checked (as per functionality)

* If User (by API) is able to create/read/update/delete gnomes.

## What will be checked (as per code).

* Language correctness
* Formatting, code documentation
* Used frameworks (yeah, don't reinvent the wheel)
* If it works;)



## Sidenotes
